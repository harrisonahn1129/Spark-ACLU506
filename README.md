# BU Spark! - ACLU project

## Project Overview

Every year a budget is approved for the city including the Boston police department (BPD). It is important to understand this data and to figure out where and how BPD is allocating these funds. For this project, students will first focus on BPD budget analysis and create a report based on the requested information below in the following semester.

## Base Project

Analyze the FY2023 City budget, including a deep dive into the BPD budget. Complete a report based on the MIRO template. This analysis will be used by City Council members to advocate for future budget allocations during the Spring budget negotiations with the Mayor and the Boston Police. You will analyze the following aspects of the annual BPD budget (all analysis should look at changes over time, at minimum compared to the previous year):

- Total BPD Budget vs. previous year (for all questions)
- BPD Budget vs. other departments budgets + change over time
- BPD Budget spend categories + change over time
- BPD proposed vs. adopted budget
- Number of police officers (compared to other boston employees)
- Number of police officers per 10,000 residents
- Number of police officers active, medical leave, etc.
- Employee compensation comparison to non-BPD employees
- Total overtime of top departments + over time
- Payroll distribution over time (base, overtime, retro, detail, etc.)
- Top 20 Earners (change from previous year)
- Top 20 Earners (OT, Base, Other)
- High level overtime analysis  (base salary vs. overtime vs. other departments) 
- Number of employees vs. OT spend
